The main file takes 2 parameters from the console: the code file and the token file.

The code file is the file that contains the code to be analyzed.
The token file is the file that contains the tokens to be analyzed.

The program will output the result to the out folder.

The scanner scans the code file character by character and checks each word to see if it is a reserved word, an identifier, a constant, a separator or an operator.
